        Hereâ€™s a little story about Uni CafÃ©! â˜•
      </h3>
      <p className="mt-8 w-[80%] text-green-500">
        Nestled in the heart of the city, Uni CafÃ© was founded with a simple
        dreamâ€”to create a cozy space where people could escape the rush of
        everyday life and enjoy a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. Our journey
        began with a passion for high-quality ingredients and a love for
        artisanal baking.ðŸ’™
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8 w-[80%] text-green-500">
        From day one, we sourced the finest coffee beans and crafted fresh,
        homemade pastries to bring a unique experience to every guest who walks
        through our doors. At Uni CafÃ©, we believe that every cup tells a story.
        Whether youâ€™re here for your morning espresso, an afternoon croissant,
        or an evening chat with friends, we want you to feel at home. Join us
        for a moment of warmth, flavor, and communityâ€”because great coffee is
        best enjoyed together. ðŸ’›
